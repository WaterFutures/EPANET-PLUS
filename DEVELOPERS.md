# Developers' Guide

## Design Paradigma

Objects should be immutable whenever possible -- this allows us to avoid unintended side effects. Never trust the user's input -- check all passed arguments carefully.

Code must work with all current Python versions from 3.9 to 3.13. Also, code must work on all major platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX.

## Code Style Guide

- Please follow the suggestions made by [Pylint](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint) and [Flake8](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8/) -- violations require good justification!

- Docstrings must be written in Numpy-docstring style.

- Naming convention for variables and methods is to use ```lower_case_with_underscores``` and ```CapitalizedWords``` for class names.

- Use type hints.

## Tests

- Tests are implemented using [pytest](https://pytest.org
) and stored in [tests/](tests/).

- Any implemented feature must come with corresponding tests.

- [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/) is used to test different Python versions -- see [noxfile.py](noxfile.py).

## Building the documentation

1. Install all REQUIREMENTS listed in [requirements.txt](docs/requirements.txt) by running:
```
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```
2. Install EPANET-PLUS by running:
```
pip install .
```
3. Build the HTML files by running:
```
make html
```
4. Build the PDF file by running
```
make latexpdf
```
