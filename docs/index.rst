EPANET-PLUS
+++++++++++

EPANET-PLUS is a C library that merges `EPANET <https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET>`_ 
and `EPANET-MSX <https://github.com/USEPA/EPANETMSX/>`_ into a single library.
Most importantly, it also provides a Python package with a high-performance interface
(i.e., C extension) to the C library, together with additional helper functions for an easier
use of EPANET and EPANET-MSX.

- High-performance (single) interface to the latest version of EPANET and EPANET-MSX
- Additional C-functions to extend EPANET and EPANET-MSX
- Python toolkit with handy functions for working with EPANET and EPANET-MSX
